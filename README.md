During the course of Project One and Two, with one of the projects, the goal is to enhance understanding of data 
structures and appropriate usage within applications. It involved analyzing and designing efficient solutions using 
data structures such as binary search tree (BTS), hash tables, and linked lists. The other project  main objective is to load
a course list from a text file into a data structure when using BTS (example) and perform a number of operations on it.
The operation included creating a data structure, loading data from a source, and printing the items; sorted alphanumerically.
The couple barriers I came by, for both projects, were constructing the code. Research and material will become a helpful
tool for construction any code. With feedback from peers and instructor, I found a ryhthm on code construction, using the right words,
and avoiding using "If" & "Else" language. This particular work on code development and software program wasn't easy for me 
because of "where to start" and from there, what can I add to ensure that my code gives an  accurate deliverance on what it is for.
My work, from the beginning, wasn't as easy from the start but understanding the main OBJECTIVEs from projects/ assignments and the output 
of the code, can make coding a little easier on expectations. I need to make sure that I run a rough draft by a peer and 
take feedback with grace and implement the feedback as I go. I was taught that no everyone understands the vocabulary of coding
so I will need to avoid using "if" and "else" (for example) to keep it simple and straight foward.
